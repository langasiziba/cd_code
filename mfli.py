"""MFLI coding: As for the integration with the MFLI Lock-in Amplifier, you would need to feed the reference signal
output from the PEM controller into the reference input of the MFLI. Then, in the MFLI's control software or
programming interface, you would set up a demodulator to use this reference signal for phase-sensitive detection.
This allows the MFLI to measure the amplitude and phase of the signal from the photomultiplier tube (PMT) at the
modulation frequency of the PEM."""
